# Backend PLUMP specification

# Productivity Scheme

For our productivity scheme we decided to work more so through tasks which will be done through Github issues in order to better track what each person has done. Communication will be done through whatsapp and in person meetings once a week. 

# Programming Language

Typescript/javascript using Nest.js. It has been proven to work well in the industry. The developer tools made for it are very useful and will help us a lot when it comes to development.

# Database 

We will be using SQLite since it is simple and works well considering we will not have a large amount of users.

# Container

We will be using Docker in order to cotain everything in order to make sure dependencies work properly and we can easily test and send code.
